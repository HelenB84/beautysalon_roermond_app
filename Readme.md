#React BeautySalon Website
This app can be used by the owner to look up her client contact info.
The app is linked to a RandomUser API for the time being.

##Background
This is my final assignment for the Frontend of my Bootcamp and also my first project I have made from scratch.
I have made this application for my sister in law who has her own beautysalon and she needed a new website where
customers can easily see which treatments she offers and also to make an appointment. The appointment data she can lookup
in her own Dashboard.
